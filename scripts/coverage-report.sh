## Test Features Covered ✨

- ✅ **Cache eviction mechanisms** - Automatic and manual cleanup of expired entries
- ✅ **TTL (Time To Live) validation** - Edge cases including zero, negative, and extreme values
- ✅ **Trading pair validation** - Format validation and known pair verification
- ✅ **Concurrent cache operations** - Thread-safe operations with race detection
- ✅ **Memory cleanup and optimization** - Efficient memory management
- ✅ **Error handling and edge cases** - Comprehensive error path testing
- ✅ **Race condition prevention** - Concurrent access safety

## Coverage Thresholds

- 🎯 **Target**: 70%+ per critical package
- 🚀 **Excellent**: 80%+ overall  
- ⭐ **Outstanding**: 90%+ overall

## Advanced Test Scenarios

### Cache Eviction Tests
- TTL-based eviction with different expiration times
- Partial eviction scenarios
- Complete cache cleanup
- Auto-eviction during Set operations
- Concurrent eviction under load

### TTL Edge Cases
- Zero TTL (immediate expiry)
- Negative TTL (pre-expired)
- Microsecond precision TTL
- Very long TTL (365+ days)
- TTL behavior during concurrent access

### Trading Pair Validation
- Valid major pairs (BTC/USD, ETH/USD, etc.)
- Case insensitive validation
- Format validation (BASE/QUOTE pattern)
- Unknown pair rejection
- Whitespace handling
- Empty and malformed input handling

## Files Generated

- \`reports/coverage/coverage.html\` - Interactive HTML coverage report
- \`reports/coverage/coverage_report.txt\` - Detailed function-level coverage
- \`reports/coverage/full_coverage.out\` - Go coverage profile
- \`reports/coverage/test_output.log\` - Complete test execution log
